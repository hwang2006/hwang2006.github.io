The HPC Asia 2021 conference was over last week. Due to the unrelenting pandemic, we have decided to hold it as a virtual event. Thanks to your interests and supports, it turned out to be the largest participation since the HPC Asia conference series resumed in 2018. The conference was quite successful in terms of the number of attendees and the diversity of the participating countries with 575 registrations from 30 countries. It's really good to be able to see a positive side of a virtual event that more people could be reached out to and connected beyond the limiations of our physical and geological bounaries.
