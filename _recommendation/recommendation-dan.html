title: "Recommdation Letter from Dan Reed"
excerpt: "...I have watched Dr. Hwang emerge as one of the world’s foremost leaders in computational 
science and high-performance computing (HPC). He is widely respected as a researcher in HPC, 
reflected not only by his publication record in international conferences and journals, but also by his 
participation and leadership in the global HPC community. He is one of the “go to” individuals for 
insights and perspectives, not only about advanced computing developments in Asia, but as a thoughtful 
shaper of global HPC policies and technology practices. His leadership in KISTI’s deployment of advanced 
computing systems has also elevated KISTI’s profile..."
