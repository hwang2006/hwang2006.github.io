title: "Recommdation Letter from Satoshi Sekiguchi"
excerpt: "...). My qualifications 
for recommending Dr. Hwang are based on my expertise as a leader in the field of Grid 
Computing for many years. As the founding Director of the Grid Technology Research Center 
(2002-2008) within the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology 
(AIST), an Independent Administrative Institution under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and 
Industry (METI), Japan; I collaborated with Dr. Hwang in the National Research Grid Initiative 
(NAREGI) project in Japan from 2003. After he moved to KISTI, I 
continued to form a long-term partnership between AIST and KISTI, and I have interacted with 
Dr. Hwang on many occasions, including at HPC, AI, and high-speed networks."
