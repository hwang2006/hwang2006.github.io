title: "Recommdation Letter from Horst Simon"
excerpt: "...I know Dr. Hwang well and have interacted with him for many years. Based on my collaboration with Dr. Hwang, I can make several 
observations, that all demonstrate that he is an exemplary researcher. He is very quick in assimilating new
technology and insights, and bringing them to bear on established problems. He has far 
reaching interests, and surveys the literature widely, often coming up with very intriguing new 
ideas. And lastly, he is always interested in applications, and enjoys working on practical 
problems. Dr. Hwang combines research excellence with a deep interest in applications. ... Since 2006 Dr. Hwang has been leading supercomputing 
development at KISTI, a distinguished national academic HPC institution worldwide. Because of his leadership KISTI has recovered a 
leading position in the TOP500 list for which I am an editor. The introduction of the Nurion 
system in 2018 was a major accomplishment for KISTI and Dr. Hwang. This system ranked #11 
on the TOP500 list, which is an appropriate location for the national system of a high tech 
country such as South Korea..."
