title: "Recommdation Letter from Horst Simon"
excerpt: "...I know Dr. Hwang well and have interacted with him for many years. Since 2006 Dr. Hwang has been leading supercomputing development at KISTI, a distinguished 
national academic HPC institution worldwide. Because of his leadership KISTI has recovered a 
leading position in the TOP500 list for which I am an editor. The introduction of the Nurion 
system in 2018 was a major accomplishment for KISTI and Dr. Hwang. This system ranked #11 
on the TOP500 list, which is an appropriate location for the national system of a high tech 
country such as South Korea..."
