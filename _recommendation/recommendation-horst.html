title: "Recommdation Letter from Horst Simon"
excerpt: "I know Dr. Hwang well and have interacted with him for many years. I regard him as an 
exceptional computer scientist, worthy of great respect. We have collaborated in the past, so I 
am quite familiar with Dr. Hwangâ€™s accomplishments as Director of the Supercomputer Center
at KISTI. His earlier research contributions in grid computing, in particular about fault 
tolerance in the grid and distributed resource management are well respected in the field. I have 
listened to his conference and colloquium presentations, and he has visited me in Berkeley 
several times when we discussed aspects of his research in detail.
....
Since 2006 Dr. Hwang has been leading supercomputing development at KISTI, a distinguished 
national academic HPC institution worldwide. Because of his leadership KISTI has recovered a 
leading position in the TOP500 list for which I am an editor. The introduction of the Nurion 
system in 2018 was a major accomplishment for KISTI and Dr. Hwang. This system ranked #11 
on the TOP500 list, which is an appropriate location for the national system of a high tech 
country such as South Korea."
