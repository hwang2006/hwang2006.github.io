title: "Recommdation Letter from Horst Simon"
excerpt: "...I know Dr. Hwang well and have interacted with him for many years... Since 2006 Dr. Hwang has been leading supercomputing 
development at KISTI, a distinguished national academic HPC institution worldwide. Because of his leadership KISTI has recovered a 
leading position in the TOP500 list for which I am an editor. The introduction of the Nurion 
system in 2018 was a major accomplishment for KISTI and Dr. Hwang. This system ranked #11 
on the TOP500 list, which is an appropriate location for the national system of a high tech 
country such as South Korea. ... I had many conversations with Dr. Hwang about how KISTI can distinguish itself as a 
worldwide leading institution in HPC. I believe there are several directions that KISTI can take 
and that Dr. Hwang is well versed to pursue. Both in the U.S. and in Japan the notion of codesign for computer architecture 
had been leading to remarkable success with the exascale systems in the U.S. and the Fugaku system in Japan..."
