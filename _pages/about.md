Soonwook Hwang is a senior principal researcher and formal director general at the [National Supercomputing Center](https://www.ksc.re.kr/) in [Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI)](https://www.kisti.re.kr/), and professor at the school of Data & High Performance Computing Science in the [University of Science and Technology (UST)](https://www.ust.ac.kr/) in Daejeon, Korea. Dr. Hwang's recent research interest lies in exploring and developing large-scale distributed deep learning practices including pre-training/fine-tuning LLMs on supercomputers, especially on National Supercomputing Facilities like KISTI in Korea and [LBNL/NERSC](https://www.nersc.gov/) in the U.S. 

He joined KISTI in 2006 as a chief architect for the Korea's national e-Science project. He led the international collaboration 
with European Grid Initative (EGI) and European Middleware Initiative (EMI) in KISTI, leading the development and deployment of [AMGA Metadata catalog software](https://amga.web.cern.ch/amga/), a defacto grid metadata service. AMGA is still being actively used as a metadata service for the data analytics for the [Belle2](https://www.belle2.org/) experiment. He also led the design and development of the [HTCaaS (High-Throughput Computing as a Service) project](http://htcaas.kisti.re.kr/wiki/), which aims to support the execution of HTC applications by seamlessly harnessing as many available computering resources as possible including supercomputers, grids and clouds. He used to work for the Japanese National Research Grid Initiative (NAREGI) in 2004 for two years, which aims to develop grid middleware 
for a next-generation CyberScience infrastructure in Japan. 

Dr. Hwang received his Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) from the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/) in 2003 under the supervision of Prof. [Carl Kesselman](https://michelson.usc.edu/faculty-directory/carl-kesselman/), who is one of the fathers of grid computing and the Globus open-source toolkit. He also received his B.S. and M.S. in Mathmatics and Computer Science from Seoul National University, Korea in 1990 and 1995, respectively.
