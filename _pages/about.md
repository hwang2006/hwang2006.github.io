Soonwook Hwang is a Senior Principal Researcher and former Director General at the [National Supercomputing Center](https://www.ksc.re.kr/) of the [Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI)](https://www.kisti.re.kr/). He is also a Professor at the KISTI school of Data & High Performance Computing Science in the [University of Science and Technology (UST)](https://www.ust.ac.kr/). Dr. Hwang serves as a columnist for [Joongdo Daily News](http://www.joongdo.co.kr/), where he has been writing science columns primarily on the topics of Supercomputing, Data and Artificial Intelligence since 2019. You can find his articles [here](https://hwang2006.github.io/year-archive/).

Dr. Hwang's recent research interests center around exploring and developing large-scale distributed deep learning practices including pre-training/fine-tuning LLMs on supercomputers, especially on National Supercomputing Facilities like KISTI in Korea and [LBNL/NERSC](https://www.nersc.gov/) in the U.S. For more details on his work, please visit his [GitHub](https://github.com/hwang2006) dedicated to distributed deep learning practices on supercomputers.

He joined KISTI in 2006 as a Chief Architect for Korea's national e-Science project. He led the development of the [AMGA Metadata catalog software](https://amga.web.cern.ch/amga/) which used to be a *de facto* grid metadata service. AMGA is still being exploited as a metadata service for data analytics in the [Belle2](https://www.belle2.org/) experiment, an international collaboration in High Energy Physics hosted by [KEK](https://www.kek.jp/) in Japan.  He also led the design and development of the [HTCaaS (High-Throughput Computing as a Service)](https://htcaas-e90544c543f1.herokuapp.com/), a platform designed to support the execution of [High-Throughput Computing (HTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_computing) tasks at scale by efficiently harnessing available computing resources, such as supercomputers, grids, and clouds.

Before his tenure at KISTI, Dr. Hwang worked for the Japanese National Research Grid Initiative (NAREGI) from 2004 to 2006. NAREGI aims to develop grid middleware for a next-generation CyberScience infrastructure in Japan. 

Dr. Hwang received his Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) from the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/) in 2003 under the supervision of Prof. [Carl Kesselman](https://michelson.usc.edu/faculty-directory/carl-kesselman/), a pioneer in grid computing and the creator of the Globus open-source toolkit. He also earned his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from Seoul National University, Korea, in 1990 and 1995, respectively.
