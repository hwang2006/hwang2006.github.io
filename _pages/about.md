<br><br>
Soonwook Hwang is a senior principal researcher and formal director general at the [National Supercomputing Center](https://www.ksc.re.kr/) in [Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI)](https://www.kisti.re.kr/), and professor at the school of Data & High Performance Computing Science in the [University of Science and Technology (UST)](https://www.ust.ac.kr/). He serves as a columnist for [Joongdo Daily News](http://www.joongdo.co.kr/), writing [science columns](https://hwang2006.github.io/year-archive/) primarily on the topics of Supercomputing and Artificial Intelligence on a regular basis since 2019.

Dr. Hwang's recent research interest lies in exploring and developing large-scale distributed deep learning practices including pre-training/fine-tuning LLMs on supercomputers, especially on National Supercomputing Facilities like KISTI in Korea and [LBNL/NERSC](https://www.nersc.gov/) in the U.S. [Here](https://github.com/hwang2006) is his GitHub site for ML/DL exploration and exploitation on supercomputers.

He joined KISTI in 2006 as a chief architect for the Korea's national e-Science project. He led the development of the [AMGA Metadata catalog software](https://amga.web.cern.ch/amga/), a de facto grid metadata service. AMGA is still being used as a metadata service for data analytics for the [Belle2](https://www.belle2.org/) experiment, an international collaboration in High Energy Physics hosted by [KEK](s://www.kek.jp/) in Japan.  He also led the design and development of the [HTCaaS (High-Throughput Computing as a Service)](http://htcaas.kisti.re.kr/wiki/), which is designed to support the execution of HTC applications at scale by seamlessly harnessing as many available computering resources (e.g., supercomputers, grids and clouds) as possible. Before joining KISTI, he worked for the Japanese National Research Grid Initiative (NAREGI) in 2004 for more than two years, which aims to develop grid middleware for a next-generation CyberScience infrastructure in Japan. 

Dr. Hwang received his Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) from the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/) in 2003 under the supervision of Prof. [Carl Kesselman](https://michelson.usc.edu/faculty-directory/carl-kesselman/), who is one of the fathers of grid computing and the Globus open-source toolkit. He also received his B.S. and M.S. in Mathmatics and Computer Science from Seoul National University, Korea in 1990 and 1995, respectively.
